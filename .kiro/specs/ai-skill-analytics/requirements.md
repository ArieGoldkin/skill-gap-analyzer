# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate AI-powered skill analysis that connects to a cloud API to evaluate user performance data, identify strengths and weaknesses, and generate personalized improvement plans. The system will use a multi-source data approach combining self-assessment, GitHub public repository analysis, and optional integrations with learning platforms to provide comprehensive analytics with user-friendly visualizations and actionable recommendations.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Self-Assessment + GitHub Public Repository Analysis

- Manual skill input with validation through mini coding challenges
- GitHub public repository analysis for skill verification and enhancement
- Basic AI analytics and improvement recommendations

### Phase 2: Enhanced Repository Integration (Optional)

- OAuth integration for private repository analysis
- Deeper code quality and architecture pattern analysis
- Advanced skill trend tracking

### Phase 3: Multi-Platform Integration

- Learning platform connections (Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
- Certification tracking and validation
- Continuous learning progress monitoring
